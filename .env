# The JSON here is turned into an object by the getHardcodedProductData function.  Some of these values are required, some are optionsl overrides.
# It provides values which are not included in the various database pulls, or override ones that are generated from it - eg minUnitChange overrides the minimum quantity which a subscription may change its numer of units (eg users), if not set
# It defaults to being the same as the minimum of users that can be purchased - ie if 10 users is the minimum purchase, you have to buy in blocks of 10, unless overridden by minUnitChange
# The option value gives more specific values for a particular product option - so you might have a general value for GFI HelpDesk, and a more specific one GFI HelpDesk Fusion - the option value, if set, overrides the main product one
