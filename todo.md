Firebase - Google Sign In, maybe Microsoft and other too

Firebase - Set Appcentre.co.uk as authorised domain in Authentication > Templates. Currently set to localhost for testing.

- need to go through both dev and prod projects carefully and configure all templates
- probably need to set up some handler pages as well, eg address verification (will we ever use that?).

Mongodb - Create indexes on the orders collection in the production database once there are some documents in it

Stripe - go live and put in STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET
