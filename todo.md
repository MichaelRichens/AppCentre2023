Firebase - Google Sign In, maybe Microsoft and other too

Firebase

- need to go through both dev and prod projects carefully and configure all templates
- probably need to set up some handler pages as well, eg address verification (will we ever use that?).

Authenticate api routes that access mongodb?

Cache expiry is set to immediate - change when going live

Success page should mre gracefully handle someone who visits it twice - see todo on that page

Handle email address change better than telling user to log out and log back in (pages/account.js)

Have some kind of pending status for when customer's arrive back before the webhook update their order?
